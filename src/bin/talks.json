            "abstract": "Spring emerged as a core open source project in early 2003 and evolved to a broad portfolio of open source projects up until 2015. This keynote reflects upon the journey so far, with a focus on the open source ecosystem that Spring lives within, including stories and anecdotes from the old days as well as from recent times. Not getting stuck in history, we’ll also look at the continuity of Spring’s philosophy and its immediate applicability to Java development challenges in 2015 and beyond.",

Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring’s flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly,but pleasant! Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it’s turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, web, batch, big-data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started.",

However, to become really proficient in using any framework (Spring Batch is no exception) a lot of trial and error is required. We’ll try to present some of the best practices we established after extensive usage of Spring Batch in many projects (both big and small). Those practices are the result of some successful and some not so successful implementations.What are the challenges that we faced? What worked well and what failed or needed to be adapted? How did we manage to overcome difficulties posed by big corporate environments and legacy systems? We hope that you’ll get out of this session learning not only what to do but also what pitfalls to avoid depending on the context in which Spring Batch is running.",

The rendering of Javascript templates is performed initially on server-side thanks to a Spring MVC + Nashorn integration, then enriched on client side with a push mechanism (Websocket or Server-Sent Events). This kind of isomorphic templating + the disruptive innovation brought by React with his virtual DOM mechanism make it possible to build a new kind of applications : responsive, with a great UX while being accessible.",
